# How to learn modern Embedded Systems
A guide to the adventurer

## Description
This is a guide to learn embedded systems, with updated resources that I think are relevant and modern. <br>
In this repository there are resources for 3 areas: <br>
* Embedded microcontroller programming
* Embedded FPGA programming
* Embedded Linux drivers and systems programming


# Engineering a project from idea to final product

This example is beautifully explained in 15 minutes with clarity and simplicity. With access to all the files (Open Hardware). A really good and simple project of IoT to learn from. Study it and see also the other videos from the same Youtuber, because Sayanee Basu is a really good educator in embedded development. A nice video to start this guide. <br>

1. Initial idea
2. Market study. Search for other products in the market and open projects.
3. Concept development
4. Circuit design
5. Procurement of components
6. PCB design with a microcontroller
7. Logistics to send the board to factory
8. Construction, soldering the components on the board
9. Boot loader flashing
10. Firmware development in Arduino-CLI
11. PC Web development configuration control over USB.
12. Publishing of all files of the project on the Web
13. Demo of the project and the project development steps on a Youtube video

### Rust on or for the Raspberry Pi

There are two modes of using Rust with the Raspberry Pi. <br>
The first one is installing Rust development tools on the Raspberry Pi itself, and the second one is installing on the PC and making cross-compilation to generate a executable that runs on the Raspberry Pi. <br>

## Arduino-CLI

This is the best way and the more professional way of working with Arduino. With your own editor, with your own make file, with all your tools in place, really the best way. All this is beautifully explained in simple terms and in a show how to do it way in the following video play list from Sayanee Basu. <br>

## ESP32 and ESP32-S2

* **Learn ESP32 with Arduino IDE** <br>
  I took this course and I recommend it, because it is a good course. It's an extensive course, good for the beginner and not so beginners. It covers in many, many projects all the micro-controller programming and the IoT - Internet Of Things stuff with the Arduino IDE. The author is constantly adding material to the course. I have experience with several different micro-controllers and in my opinion, the ESP32 and the future ESP32-S02 are good safe bet's to learn micro-controllers in general and IoT in particular. Also they are low cost and have large range of advanced features. <br>

* **Learn ESP32 The ESP-IDF** <br>
  I took this course and I recommend it highly, this is an excellent course. This is a course for a more professional or more in depth persons, for the ones that really need to know what's under the hood and want to make use of every feature, capacity and possibility that the incredible ESP32 provides. The other kind of person that I can imagine doing this course is if you are already a developer for example in PC or web context, you will rapidly understand all the details and understand all the micro-controller power that the author explains to you. The framework used (ESP-IDF) is the one made by ExpressIF, the enterprise that makes the ESP32. The knowledge that you will obtain from this course is really profound, although the author goes to extensive length to explain the foundations that you need even in more advanced C programming, it is for people that already used a micro-controller before, be it a simple Arduino Uno board, or a more professional one. But I would like to say clearly that, the knowledge that you obtain from this course is profound. In my opinion it gives you the tools, it enables you to work professional on this field developing embedded systems software with the ESP32 including IoT. The course already as 12 hours, with all the code accessible in GitHub, but it's author is currently still adding content. It also includes advanced sections on freeRTOS. It uses in a very intelligent and useful way the free Visual Studio Code Editor in Windows and Linux, even allowing debugging in ESP32 inside Visual Studio Code with a cheap 10 dollars JTAG addon board. <br>

* **PCB design course KiCAD like a Pro**
  I took this course and reed the book and I recommend it highly, this is an excellent course. There comes a time that every person that enter this field of electronics or embedded systems, will feel the need to make a professional looking board for the system that you design. When breadboard, soldering wires or simples pre-fabricated modules connected by wires, are not enough. That is the time to start learning about how to design a PCB's. Starting by drawing the schematic, to the design of the effective PCB, reaching out to a fabric to make you PCB and then assemble in your home or in the fabric with an assembly service. This course cover it all. KiCAD is a free open source tool that is of professional grade. <br>
